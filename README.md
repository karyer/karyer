- 👋 Hi, I’m @karyer
- 👀 I’m interested in making a big career change. I have started off my career as a musician, then joined the military, and now I am close to completing my BS in Information Technology with a concentration in programming. I am working to make programming part of my new career!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL (SQLite and MySQL) and how to secure DBMS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I'm eager and willing to learn.
- 📫 You can reach out to me via e-mail at emilyrkary@gmail.com
